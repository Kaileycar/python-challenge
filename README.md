https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67345588/python3-how-to-use-enumerate-to-print-total-items-in-a-list: This website helped me figure out how to use the enumerate function in python. This helped with getting the sum of the data that I needed for PyBank and PyPoll.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53710235/how-to-get-the-sum-of-a-csv-column-list-to-print: This website helped me to skip the header with the enumerate function. I also learned about the csv Dict.Reader through here. 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56123027/how-to-subtract-an-element-from-previous-one-in-python: This website gave me a few options to test out and try. For my PyBank assignment, I tried doing a 'while loop' to find the difference of each row at first, but kept coming up with errors. I went back and tried a 'for loop' again and tried the 'range' function along with it. I had to add an 'if, else' statement to this in order for the indexes for the 'months' and 'average change' to be the same. 

I got help with figuring out how to get the same amount of indexes with Ryan after class on Tuesday.
Ryan also helped me Monday after class to find a way to grab the indexes of the min and max value in PyBank

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/get-unique-values-from-a-list-in-python: This website helped me figure out how to go through a list a pick out unique values. I tried the "list.append()" function at first, but found that the "set()" function worked better for my script.

Along with these websites and help during Office Hours, I was also apart of a study group Sunday night on Zoom. It was with Eva, Aleid, Raina, Hannah, and Pan.
